# :bowtie: A [DevChallenge.io](https://devchallenges.io) challenge

Today, we are going doing a challenge of DevChallenges.io. It´s on front-end section (although I think that it´a a design challenge, maybe).

It´s simple, We just need to make some buttons: different sizes, colors, shapes...

Also I´ve made a responsive navbar (sidebar rather) although I have to get better the code organization.
